## Tweet Sentiment Classification

This is the project of my course ECE/CS 7220. Many thanks to Dr. DeSouza, who is the intructor of this course. 

It is implemented using NLTK and Scikit-learn. KNN and Naive Bayes are used. ~~I will open source it when my class is finished.~~ The class is finished, so I open source my code.
